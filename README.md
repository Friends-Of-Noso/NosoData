This project contains various Object Oriented Programming Classes to deal with [Noso Coins](https://github.com/Noso-Project/NosoWallet)' data files.

It contains classes that read from the current files, in the Legacy namespace.

It contains classes that can absorb one of those Legacy classes. These classes are also able to deal with `JSON` Input/Output.

## Todo

1. Add the PoS and MNs rewards to the non Legacy classes and their `JSON` Input/Output. Make sure all tests pass green.
2. Create the Legacy class for the wallet file and it's counter part with `JSON` Input/Output. Create and make sure all tests pass green.
